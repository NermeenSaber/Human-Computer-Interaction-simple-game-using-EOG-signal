# Human-Computer-Interaction-simple-game-using-EOG-signal

This Human Computer Interfaces (HCI) project aims to detect the movement of the EOG (Eye) Signal and move the circle in the same direction.

For data Preprocessing :
Normalization, Butterworth bandpass filter and down-sampling were applied. 

For Feature Extraction : 
Wavelet transformation and Autoregressive modelling were applied.

Programming Language : python 3.9
Libraries used : numpy , scipy, matplotlib, os , sklearn
Classifier : RandomForestClassifier , svm , Gaussian Naive Bayes
